# React Best Practices in 2024

React continues to evolve, and with it, our understanding of how to write better, more maintainable React applications. Here are some patterns I've found particularly useful in recent projects.

## Component Composition Over Inheritance

React has always favored composition, but it's worth reinforcing this principle:

```jsx
// Good: Composition
function Button({ variant, children, ...props }) {
  return (
    <button className={`btn btn-${variant}`} {...props}>
      {children}
    </button>
  );
}

// Usage
<Button variant="primary" onClick={handleClick}>
  Save Changes
</Button>;
```

## Custom Hooks for Logic Reuse

Custom hooks are perfect for extracting and sharing stateful logic:

```jsx
function useLocalStorage(key, initialValue) {
  const [storedValue, setStoredValue] = useState(() => {
    try {
      const item = window.localStorage.getItem(key);
      return item ? JSON.parse(item) : initialValue;
    } catch (error) {
      return initialValue;
    }
  });

  const setValue = (value) => {
    try {
      setStoredValue(value);
      window.localStorage.setItem(key, JSON.stringify(value));
    } catch (error) {
      console.error("Error saving to localStorage:", error);
    }
  };

  return [storedValue, setValue];
}
```

## Performance Optimization

Modern React provides excellent performance out of the box, but there are still opportunities for optimization:

1. **Use React.memo wisely** - Only for components with expensive renders
2. **Optimize context usage** - Split contexts to prevent unnecessary re-renders
3. **Lazy loading** - Use React.lazy for code splitting

## Conclusion

The React ecosystem continues to mature, and these patterns represent some of the current best practices. Remember, the best code is code that your team can understand and maintain effectively.
